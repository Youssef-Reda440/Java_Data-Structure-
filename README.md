# 📦 Java Data Structures Implementation

## 📖 Description
This repository contains **custom implementations of fundamental Data Structures in Java**, built completely from scratch without using Java built-in collection frameworks.  
The main goal of this project is to deeply understand how each data structure works internally through manual implementation and practical testing.

This repository is suitable for:
- Computer Science & Engineering students
- Data Structures learning & revision
- Interview preparation
- Academic projects
- Personal portfolio

---

## 🧠 Implemented Data Structures

- ✅ Array List (Dynamic Array)
- ✅ Array of Objects
- ✅ Single Linked List
- ✅ Doubly Linked List
- ✅ Stack Using Array
- ✅ Stack Using Linked List
- ✅ Queue Using Array
- ✅ Queue Using Linked List

Each data structure has:
- Its **own folder**
- A **complete Java implementation**
- A **Main.java for testing**
- A **separate README.md with full explanation**

## ⏱ Time Complexity Overview

| Data Structure | Access | Search | Insert | Delete |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Array List     | O(1)   | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(n)   |
| Linked List    | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(1)   | O(n)   |
| Stack          | O(1)   | —      | O(1)   | O(1)   |
| Queue          | O(1)   | —      | O(1)   | O(1)   |
