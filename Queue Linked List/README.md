# 📌 Queue Implementation Using Linked List

## 📖 Description
This project contains a custom implementation of a **Queue Data Structure using a Linked List** in **Java**.  
The queue follows the **FIFO (First In First Out)** principle and supports dynamic size without a fixed capacity, unlike array-based queues.

---

## 🛠 Features
- Enqueue (Insert elements into the queue)
- Dequeue (Remove elements from the queue)
- Peek (Get the front element)
- Check if the queue is empty
- Display all queue elements
- Dynamic memory allocation (No fixed size)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **VS Code**
2. Make sure **JDK** is installed
3. Run the file **Main.java**

## ✅ Sample Output
Is queue Empty? true
10 enqueue to queue
20 enqueue to queue
30 enqueue to queue
40 enqueue to queue
50 enqueue to queue
60 enqueue to queue
Dequeue : 10
Is queue Empty? false
70 enqueue to queue
Dequeue : 20
Is queue Empty? true

## ⏱ Time Complexity
| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Enqueue   | O(1) |
| Dequeue   | O(1) |
| Peek      | O(1) |
| Display   | O(n) |
