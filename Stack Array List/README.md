# 📌 Stack Implementation Using Array

## 📖 Description
This project contains a custom implementation of a **Stack Data Structure using an Array** in **Java**, built from scratch without using any built-in collection libraries.  
The stack follows the **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle and supports basic stack operations such as push, pop, top, and display.

---

## 🛠 Features
- Push elements into the stack
- Pop elements from the stack
- Get the top element
- Check if the stack is empty
- Check if the stack is full
- Display all stack elements
- Measure execution time (in main method)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **VS Code**
2. Make sure **JDK** is installed
3. Run the file **Main.java**

## ✅ Sample Output
10 Pushed to Stack
20 Pushed to Stack
30 Pushed to Stack
40 Pushed to Stack
50 Pushed to Stack
The StackArray Is Full, We cannot add 60
Stack Elements : 10 20 30 40 50
Top Element : 50
Pop Element : 50
Stack Elements : 10 20 30 40
Time elapsed: 1 ms

- Arrays
- Top Pointer
- Overflow & Underflow Handling
- Time Measurement
- Time Complexity

## ⏱ Time Complexity
| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Push      | O(1) |
| Pop       | O(1) |
| Top       | O(1) |
| Display   | O(n) |
