# 📌 Single Linked List Implementation

## 📖 Description
This project contains a custom implementation of a **Single Linked List** using **Java**, built from scratch without using any built-in data structure libraries.  
Each node contains data and a reference to the next node only, allowing one-directional traversal of the list.

---

## 🛠 Features
- Append elements to the end of the list
- Insert elements at the beginning
- Insert elements at a specific position
- Delete elements by value
- Search for elements
- Traverse and display the list
- Merge two linked lists into one

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **VS Code**
2. Make sure **JDK** is installed
3. Run the file **Main.java**

## ✅ Sample Output
Single LinkedList 1
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> null
Single LinkedList 1 After Inserting
5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> null
Single LinkedList 1 After Inserting
5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 60 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> null
Single LinkedList 1 After Deleting
5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 60 -> 40 -> 50 -> null
Single LinkedList 1 After Inserting
0 -> 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 60 -> 40 -> 50 -> null
Single LinkedList 2
80 -> 90 -> 100 -> null
After Merge LinkedList 1 & 2
0 -> 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 60 -> 40 -> 50 -> 80 -> 90 -> 100 -> null
Single LinkedList 2 After Appending
80 -> 90 -> 100 -> 110 -> null
Finally Single LinkedList 1
0 -> 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 60 -> 40 -> 50 -> 80 -> 90 -> 100 -> null

## ⏱ Time Complexity
| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Append    | O(n) |
| Insert at Beginning | O(1) |
| Insert at Position | O(n) |
| Delete    | O(n) |
| Search    | O(n) |
| Traverse  | O(n) |
| Merge     | O(n) |
