# 📌 Doubly Linked List Implementation

## 📖 Description
This project contains a custom implementation of a **Doubly Linked List** using **Java**, built from scratch without using any built-in data structure libraries.  
Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.

---

## 🛠 Features
- Append elements to the end of the list
- Insert elements at the beginning
- Insert elements at a specific position
- Delete elements by value
- Search for elements
- Traverse the list forward
- Traverse the list backward
- Merge two doubly linked lists

## ⏱ Time Complexity
| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Append    | O(n) |
| Insert at Beginning | O(1) |
| Insert at Position | O(n) |
| Delete    | O(n) |
| Search    | O(n) |
| Traverse  | O(n) |
| Merge     | O(n) |
