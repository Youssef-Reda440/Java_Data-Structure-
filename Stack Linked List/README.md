# 📌 Stack Implementation Using Linked List

## 📖 Description
This project contains a custom implementation of a **Stack Data Structure using a Linked List** in **Java**, built from scratch without using any built-in collection libraries.  
The stack follows the **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle and uses dynamic memory allocation instead of a fixed-size array.

---

## 🛠 Features
- Push elements into the stack
- Pop elements from the stack
- Get the top element
- Check if the stack is empty
- Display all stack elements
- Dynamic size (No fixed capacity)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **VS Code**
2. Make sure **JDK** is installed
3. Run the file **Main.java**

## ✅ Sample Output
10 Pushed to Stack
20 Pushed to Stack
30 Pushed to Stack
40 Pushed to Stack
50 Pushed to Stack
60 Pushed to Stack
Stack Elements : 60 50 40 30 20 10
Top Element : 60
Pop Element : 60
Stack Elements : 50 40 30 20 10

## ⏱ Time Complexity
| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Push      | O(1) |
| Pop       | O(1) |
| Top       | O(1) |
| Display   | O(n) |
